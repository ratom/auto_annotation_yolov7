This is a real implementation of the active learning framework for a cattle identification system using YOLO model. To address the challenges of real world implementation of muzzle-based cattle identification, we need an auto generated labeling or annotating system to label the data automatically. In this example, we used YOLO model, which can be replaced by any model of your choice. The basic pipeline of our proposed method is shown by the figure.
